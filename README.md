# Firebase
In this project, firebase was used to store user login information and store the posts entered by users as data.

### To connect to Firebase, we first need to download the cocoapods library using the terminal.
*$ sudo gem install cocoapods*

### Then, using the terminal again, the file containing the project is opened and the pod files are initiated.
*pod init*

### We need to add the products we want to use in firebase into the pod file.
*pod 'Firebase/Auth'*

*pod 'Firebase/Firestore'*

*pod 'Firebase/Storage'*

**We can use necessary library with these codes.**

### Finally, using the terminal, the file containing the project is opened and these products are installed.
*pod install*
